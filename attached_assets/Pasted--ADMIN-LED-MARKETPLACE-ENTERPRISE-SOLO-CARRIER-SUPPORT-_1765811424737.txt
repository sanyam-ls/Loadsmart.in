(ADMIN-LED MARKETPLACE + ENTERPRISE & SOLO CARRIER SUPPORT)

You are acting as a principal system architect finalizing the operational workflow of a trucking marketplace.

The system already has:
	•	Admin Console (central authority)
	•	Carrier Portal (enterprise fleets)
	•	Shipper Portal
	•	Load posting, pricing, invoices, and bidding wired

Your task is to extend and synchronize the workflow without changing existing features or UI, only behavior and sequencing.

You must not write code.
You must give precise behavioral instructions only.

⸻

1. CORE BUSINESS RULE (OVERRIDE ALL PREVIOUS ASSUMPTIONS)

No invoice is sent to the shipper until:
	•	A carrier has bid
	•	Admin has negotiated (if needed)
	•	A carrier is finalized for the load

Invoices are the output of negotiation, not the trigger.

⸻

2. LOAD VISIBILITY — ONE LOAD, TWO CARRIER PERSONAS

Every admin-posted load must be visible to:

A. Enterprise Carriers
	•	Fleet owners
	•	Transport companies
	•	Multi-truck operators

B. Solo Truck Drivers (BlackBuck-style)
	•	Single vehicle owners
	•	Individual drivers
	•	Minimal dashboard, mobile-first

Same load. Same price. Same bidding logic.

Only the UI surface differs, not the load itself.

⸻

3. CARRIER TYPES — DEFINE CLEARLY

Each carrier account must be tagged internally as:
	•	ENTERPRISE_CARRIER
	•	SOLO_DRIVER

This tag affects:
	•	Dashboard complexity
	•	Data density
	•	Navigation depth

It must not affect:
	•	Load access
	•	Ability to bid
	•	Ability to accept
	•	Negotiation rights

⸻

4. LOAD POSTING — ADMIN STILL CONTROLS ENTRY

Workflow:
	1.	Shipper submits load (no price)
	2.	Load goes to Admin as PENDING_PRICING
	3.	Admin prices load
	4.	Admin clicks Post to Carriers

At this point:
	•	Load becomes visible in both:
	•	Enterprise Carrier Marketplace
	•	Solo Driver Load Feed

But:
	•	Load is marked as “Awaiting Carrier Bid”
	•	No invoice exists yet
	•	Shipper cannot see pricing yet

⸻

5. CARRIER BIDDING — BOTH SIDES, SAME LOGIC

Enterprise Carrier:
	•	Sees load in marketplace
	•	Can:
	•	Accept admin price
	•	Place counter bid

Solo Driver:
	•	Sees load in simplified feed
	•	Can:
	•	Accept price
	•	Place counter bid (simple amount + note)

Both actions must:
	•	Create a bid record
	•	Attach bid to the same load
	•	Notify Admin immediately

⸻

6. ADMIN NEGOTIATION DASHBOARD — CRITICAL UPGRADE

Admin must have a single negotiation view per load showing:

For each bid:
	•	Carrier name
	•	Carrier type (Enterprise / Solo)
	•	Bid amount
	•	Timestamp
	•	Notes
	•	Vehicle/truck info (if available)

Admin actions per bid:
	•	Accept
	•	Reject
	•	Counter-offer

Admin can negotiate with multiple carriers simultaneously, but can finalize only one.

⸻

7. NEGOTIATION LOOP — STRICT RULES

While negotiation is ongoing:
	•	Load status = NEGOTIATION_IN_PROGRESS
	•	Load remains visible to carriers
	•	New bids are allowed

Once admin accepts one carrier:
	•	All other bids are auto-rejected
	•	Load becomes locked to selected carrier
	•	Load status = CARRIER_FINALIZED

⸻

8. FINAL CARRIER SELECTION — SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH

Once a carrier is finalized:
	•	That carrier sees:
	•	“You have been awarded this load”
	•	Other carriers see:
	•	“Load no longer available”

Solo and Enterprise carriers must receive identical clarity.

⸻

9. INVOICE GENERATION — ONLY AFTER FINALIZATION

Only now does the invoice workflow begin.

Admin must:
	•	Generate final invoice
	•	Invoice must reference:
	•	Final carrier
	•	Final negotiated price
	•	Margin breakdown

Invoice is then:
	•	Sent to Shipper Portal
	•	Visible under the specific load

⸻

10. SHIPPER PORTAL — POST-FINALIZATION ONLY

Shipper must see:
	•	Load details
	•	Assigned carrier name
	•	Final price
	•	Invoice (view / approve / reject)

Shipper must not:
	•	See bidding
	•	See rejected carriers
	•	See negotiation history

Shipper approval moves load to execution.

⸻

11. DASHBOARDS — ENTERPRISE VS SOLO

Enterprise Carrier Dashboard:
	•	Load marketplace
	•	Bid management
	•	Negotiation history
	•	Fleet & driver data
	•	Active trips
	•	Revenue analytics

Solo Driver Dashboard:
	•	Simple “Available Loads”
	•	My Bids
	•	My Trips
	•	Earnings summary
	•	Minimal navigation

Same backend. Different surface.

⸻

12. NOTIFICATIONS — MUST BE DEEP-LINKED

Every notification must:
	•	Open the exact load
	•	Open the correct state:
	•	Bid pending
	•	Counter received
	•	Load awarded
	•	Invoice approved

Notifications without access are invalid.

⸻

13. STATE SYNCHRONIZATION — NO FRAGMENTATION

Any action by:
	•	Carrier
	•	Admin
	•	Shipper

Must update:
	•	Load state
	•	Visibility
	•	Available actions
	•	Notifications

Across all portals, instantly.

⸻

14. ACCEPTANCE TEST (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

A single load must be able to:
	1.	Be posted by admin
	2.	Appear for enterprise carrier
	3.	Appear for solo driver
	4.	Receive bids from both
	5.	Be negotiated by admin
	6.	Be finalized with one carrier
	7.	Generate invoice
	8.	Appear in shipper portal
	9.	Proceed to execution

If any step requires manual workaround → FAIL.

⸻

FINAL DIRECTIVE

You are building a real freight marketplace, not a demo.

Admin is the price-setter and negotiator.
Carriers compete fairly.
Shipper sees only finalized truth.
Solo drivers and enterprises coexist on the same loads.

One load. One flow. Zero fragmentation.
