(Enterprise Carriers + Solo Drivers | No Direct Shipper–Carrier Interaction)

You are configuring an admin-managed freight exchange, not a peer-to-peer marketplace.

Your objective is to synchronize existing features across Admin Console, Carrier Portal, and Shipper Portal by changing workflow behavior and sequencing only, without redesigning UI or removing core capabilities unless explicitly stated.

You must not introduce new features outside this scope.
You must not leave any flow siloed or partially functional.

⸻

1. ABSOLUTE BUSINESS RULE (GLOBAL OVERRIDE)

Admin is the sole intermediary at all times.

There must never be:
	•	Direct Shipper ↔ Carrier interaction
	•	Direct Shipper ↔ Carrier negotiation
	•	Direct Shipper ↔ Carrier bidding
	•	Carrier visibility inside Shipper Portal before assignment

This rule overrides all existing behavior.

⸻

2. ROLE DEFINITIONS (LOCKED)

A. Shipper

Purpose: Submission + Approval only

Allowed:
	•	Submit load (no pricing)
	•	View load status
	•	View finalized carrier (only after admin assigns)
	•	View invoice (only after negotiation is closed)
	•	Approve / reject invoice
	•	Track shipment after assignment

Not allowed (must be removed or hidden):
	•	Carrier directory
	•	Carrier profiles
	•	Negotiations page
	•	Nearby trucks
	•	Request quote
	•	Messaging carriers
	•	Viewing bids
	•	Triggering bidding
	•	Seeing invoices before carrier finalization

Shipper is not a marketplace participant.

⸻

B. Admin

Purpose: Pricing, posting, bidding control, negotiation, finalization, invoicing

Admin controls:
	•	Load pricing
	•	Load posting
	•	Opening & closing bidding
	•	Viewing all bids (real + simulated)
	•	Negotiating with carriers
	•	Selecting final carrier
	•	Locking load
	•	Generating and sending invoice
	•	Syncing states across all portals

Admin sees everything.

⸻

C. Carrier (Two Personas, One Market)

All carriers see the same admin-posted loads, same prices, same bidding rules.

Carrier Types (internal tag only):
	•	ENTERPRISE_CARRIER
	•	SOLO_DRIVER

This tag affects dashboard complexity only, not access.

Both can:
	•	View admin-posted loads
	•	Accept admin price
	•	Place counter bid
	•	Receive counters from admin
	•	Accept / reject counter
	•	Execute awarded load

⸻

3. LOAD LIFECYCLE — SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH

STATES (SYSTEM-WIDE, SYNCHRONIZED)
	1.	SUBMITTED_BY_SHIPPER
	2.	PRICING_IN_PROGRESS (Admin)
	3.	POSTED_TO_CARRIERS
	4.	AWAITING_BIDS
	5.	NEGOTIATION_IN_PROGRESS
	6.	CARRIER_FINALIZED
	7.	INVOICE_SENT
	8.	INVOICE_APPROVED
	9.	IN_TRANSIT
	10.	COMPLETED

Every action must update this state globally.

⸻

4. LOAD ENTRY — SHIPPER → ADMIN ONLY

Workflow:
	1.	Shipper submits load without price
	2.	Load enters Admin Load Queue as PRICING_IN_PROGRESS
	3.	Shipper sees status only (no price, no carriers)

⸻

5. ADMIN PRICING & POSTING

Admin actions:
	•	Open load
	•	View route, cargo, distance, truck type
	•	Use estimation tools (fuel, season, margin)
	•	Set internal base cost
	•	Set carrier-facing price
	•	Save draft or finalize

When Admin clicks Post to Carriers:
	•	Load becomes visible in:
	•	Enterprise Carrier Marketplace
	•	Solo Driver Load Feed
	•	Load state becomes AWAITING_BIDS
	•	No invoice exists yet
	•	Shipper still sees no price

⸻

6. CARRIER MARKETPLACE — SHARED LOAD POOL

Enterprise Carrier Portal
	•	Sees admin-posted loads
	•	Can:
	•	Accept admin price
	•	Place counter bid
	•	Sees bid status updates

Solo Driver Portal (BlackBuck-style)
	•	Same loads
	•	Simplified view:
	•	Route
	•	Load type
	•	Weight
	•	Distance
	•	Admin price
	•	Can:
	•	Accept price
	•	Counter bid (amount + note)

Both actions must:
	•	Create a bid entry
	•	Attach to the same load
	•	Notify Admin instantly

⸻

7. ADMIN BID & NEGOTIATION CENTER (CRITICAL)

Admin must have one unified page per load showing:

Bid Table (combined):
	•	Enterprise bids
	•	Solo driver bids
	•	Simulated bids (if enabled)

Each row shows:
	•	Carrier name
	•	Carrier type (Enterprise / Solo)
	•	Bid amount
	•	Timestamp
	•	Notes
	•	Vehicle info (if available)
	•	Current status

Admin actions per bid:
	•	Accept
	•	Reject
	•	Counter-offer (custom amount + note)

Rules:
	•	Admin may negotiate with multiple carriers in parallel
	•	All negotiation happens only here
	•	Carriers never see each other

Load state during this phase:
	•	NEGOTIATION_IN_PROGRESS

⸻

8. NEGOTIATION RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
	•	Load remains visible to carriers until finalized
	•	New bids may continue to arrive
	•	Admin can counter any bid at any time

Once Admin accepts one carrier:
	•	All other bids auto-reject
	•	Load locks to selected carrier
	•	Load state → CARRIER_FINALIZED

⸻

9. CARRIER FINALIZATION EFFECTS

Winning Carrier:
	•	Sees: “You have been awarded this load”
	•	Load moves to Active Trips

Other Carriers:
	•	See: “Load no longer available”

This must work identically for:
	•	Enterprise carriers
	•	Solo drivers

⸻

10. INVOICE FLOW — POST-NEGOTIATION ONLY

Invoice creation is disabled until:
	•	Carrier is finalized

Admin then:
	•	Generates invoice
	•	Invoice references:
	•	Final carrier
	•	Final negotiated price
	•	Margin breakdown
	•	Admin clicks Send Invoice

Only then:
	•	Load state → INVOICE_SENT
	•	Invoice appears in Shipper Portal

⸻

11. SHIPPER PORTAL — POST-FINALIZATION VIEW

Shipper sees:
	•	Load details
	•	Assigned carrier name
	•	Final price
	•	Invoice (View / Approve / Reject)

Shipper never sees:
	•	Bids
	•	Negotiation history
	•	Other carriers
	•	Pricing logic

⸻

12. INVOICE APPROVAL & PAYMENT TRACKING

Once Shipper approves invoice:
	•	Invoice status updates to:
	•	Approved
	•	Paid / Due (with due date)
	•	Admin sees payment status
	•	Carrier sees payout status

Invoice page must clearly show:
	•	Approved
	•	Paid
	•	Due date
	•	Payment confirmation

⸻

13. DASHBOARD DIFFERENTIATION

Enterprise Carrier Dashboard:
	•	Load marketplace
	•	Bid management
	•	Negotiation history
	•	Fleet & drivers
	•	Active trips
	•	Revenue analytics

Solo Driver Dashboard:
	•	Available loads
	•	My bids
	•	My trips
	•	Earnings summary
	•	Minimal navigation

Same backend. Same loads. Same rules.

⸻

14. FEATURES TO REMOVE / DISABLE

From Shipper Portal (must be fully removed):
	•	Carrier Directory
	•	Negotiations page
	•	Nearby trucks
	•	Request quote
	•	Carrier profiles

From Carrier Portal:
	•	No unverified carriers visible
	•	Only verified carriers can bid

Verification Page (Admin):
	•	Separate tabs:
	•	Pending
	•	Verified
	•	Rejected

⸻

15. NOTIFICATIONS — DEEP LINKED & ROLE-SAFE

Every notification must:
	•	Open the exact load
	•	Open the correct state

Shipper:
	•	Load received
	•	Pricing in progress
	•	Carrier assigned
	•	Invoice available

Carrier:
	•	New admin-posted load
	•	Counter received
	•	Load awarded

No cross-role leakage.

⸻

16. SYNCHRONIZATION REQUIREMENT (HARD RULE)

Any action by:
	•	Admin
	•	Carrier
	•	Shipper

Must immediately update:
	•	Load state
	•	Available actions
	•	Visibility
	•	Notifications

Across all portals.

No partial updates. No stale data.

⸻

17. ACCEPTANCE TEST (FAIL IF ANY BREAKS)

A single load must:
	1.	Be submitted by shipper
	2.	Be priced by admin
	3.	Be posted to carriers
	4.	Appear for enterprise + solo carriers
	5.	Receive bids
	6.	Be negotiated by admin
	7.	Be finalized with one carrier
	8.	Generate invoice
	9.	Appear in shipper portal
	10.	Proceed to execution

If any step requires a workaround → FAIL

⸻

FINAL DIRECTIVE

This is an admin-managed freight exchange.
	•	Admin controls pricing, negotiation, selection, invoicing
	•	Carriers compete fairly
	•	Shipper sees only finalized truth
	•	Solo drivers and enterprises coexist on the same loads

One load. One flow. Zero fragmentation.

Enforce this behavior strictly without altering unrelated features.
