(LEAN CARRIER MODE · SINGLE TRUCK · ADMIN-LED ECOSYSTEM)

You are extending an existing admin-managed freight marketplace that already supports enterprise carriers.
You must now introduce a SOLO DRIVER MODE that is:
	•	Lean
	•	Mobile-first
	•	Single-truck focused
	•	Fully synchronized with Admin and Shipper workflows
	•	NOT a downgraded enterprise clone

No existing enterprise features may break.

⸻

1. CARRIER TYPES — HARD SEPARATION (CORE RULE)

Every carrier account must be tagged at registration as ONE AND ONLY ONE:
	•	ENTERPRISE_CARRIER
	•	SOLO_DRIVER

This tag controls:
	•	Dashboard structure
	•	Feature visibility
	•	Data models
	•	Metrics aggregation

This tag must never affect:
	•	Load visibility (after admin posts)
	•	Bidding rights
	•	Negotiation rights
	•	OTP-controlled trip execution
	•	Payment eligibility

⸻

2. SOLO DRIVER — DEFINITION (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

A Solo Driver is:
	•	One person
	•	One truck
	•	One primary driver (self)
	•	No fleet hierarchy
	•	No dispatch layer
	•	No multi-driver logic

The system must never assume multiple trucks or drivers for this account type.

⸻

3. SOLO DRIVER — NAVIGATION RULES

When carrier_type = SOLO_DRIVER, enforce:

REMOVE / HIDE
	•	Drivers (entire section)
	•	Fleet analytics by driver
	•	Driver-wise revenue splits
	•	Multi-truck assignment logic

KEEP / ADAPT
	•	Dashboard
	•	Available Loads
	•	My Bids
	•	Active Trips
	•	Trip History
	•	Revenue
	•	Documents
	•	Settings

Navigation must feel lighter, not empty.

⸻

4. FLEET INTELLIGENCE — SOLO DRIVER MODE

Rename Internally (logic only)

“Fleet Intelligence” → My Truck Intelligence

Data Model Rules
	•	Total Trucks = 1 (locked)
	•	Active Trucks = 0 or 1
	•	Available = derived automatically
	•	Maintenance = manual toggle or document-based

Metrics to Show
	•	Truck Status (Idle / In Trip / Maintenance)
	•	Utilization %
	•	Distance covered (periodic)
	•	Active alerts

REMOVE
	•	Fleet by Type chart
	•	Multi-truck comparisons
	•	Aggregate fleet distributions

ADD (Solo-Specific Intelligence)
	•	Upcoming document expiry (RC, Insurance, Permit, PUC)
	•	Last service date
	•	Next recommended service window
	•	Compliance status (green / amber / red)

This must feel personal, not corporate.

⸻

5. DRIVER INFORMATION — SOLO DRIVER MODE

Replace “Drivers” Section With:

My Profile (Driver + Owner)

Contains:
	•	Name
	•	Phone (OTP verified)
	•	License details
	•	Aadhaar / PAN
	•	Emergency contact
	•	Driver rating (from completed loads)

No add / remove drivers.
No delegation.
No driver switching.

⸻

6. DOCUMENTS — SOLO DRIVER RULES

Documents are mission-critical for solo drivers.

Required Categories
	•	Driving License
	•	RC
	•	Insurance
	•	Permit
	•	Fitness
	•	PUC

Behavior
	•	Expiry alerts must be proactive
	•	Admin must see expiry risk in real time
	•	Expired documents must:
	•	Restrict bidding
	•	Restrict trip start OTP
	•	Trigger admin alerts

Documents are not passive uploads — they are permission gates.

⸻

7. REVENUE — SOLO DRIVER MODE

REMOVE
	•	Revenue by driver
	•	Driver performance comparisons

KEEP / ADD
	•	Earnings timeline
	•	Per-trip payout
	•	Pending payments
	•	Completed payouts
	•	Admin deductions (transparent)
	•	Net earnings

Revenue must be simple, cash-flow focused, not managerial.

⸻

8. LOAD MARKETPLACE — SAME LOAD, DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE

Core Rule

Admin-posted loads must appear to:
	•	Enterprise carriers
	•	Solo drivers

Same load.
Same price.
Same bidding logic.

Solo Driver Load View
	•	Simplified cards
	•	One-tap bid / accept
	•	Clear payout visibility
	•	Minimal metadata clutter

No advanced fleet matching required, but:
	•	Compatibility scoring still applies
	•	Route distance clarity is mandatory

⸻

9. BIDDING & NEGOTIATION — SOLO DRIVER INCLUDED

Solo drivers must be able to:
	•	Place bids
	•	Receive admin counters
	•	Negotiate via chat-based interface
	•	Accept final price

Negotiation Interface
	•	Appears as a chatbot-style conversation
	•	Admin ↔ Carrier only
	•	Simulated + real messages mixed
	•	Inline buttons:
	•	Counter
	•	Accept
	•	Reject

Solo drivers must never negotiate with shippers.

⸻

10. OTP-CONTROLLED TRIP FLOW — SAME RULES APPLY

Solo drivers must follow identical OTP logic as enterprise carriers:
	•	OTP at registration
	•	OTP to start trip (admin-generated)
	•	OTP to end trip (admin-generated)

No shortcuts for solo drivers.

⸻

11. ADMIN VISIBILITY — SOLO DRIVER FIRST-CLASS

Admin must be able to:
	•	Identify carrier type instantly
	•	See “Solo Driver” tag everywhere
	•	View truck + driver + document status in one place
	•	Filter bids by:
	•	Solo
	•	Enterprise
	•	Assign loads directly to verified solo drivers if needed

Solo drivers are not second-class carriers.

⸻

12. SIMULATED + REAL DATA — CONSISTENCY RULE

For SOLO DRIVER:
	•	Simulated loads must behave exactly like real ones
	•	Simulated negotiations must follow real state transitions
	•	Simulated revenue must reflect real payout logic

Simulation is for demonstration, not fake workflows.

⸻

13. HARD FAILURE CONDITIONS (DO NOT ALLOW)

❌ Solo driver sees “Add Driver”
❌ Solo driver sees fleet-wide analytics
❌ Revenue broken down by drivers
❌ Multiple trucks allowed
❌ Document expiry ignored
❌ Negotiation bypassing admin

Any of the above = workflow failure.

⸻

FINAL ENFORCEMENT STATEMENT

This platform is:
	•	Admin-managed
	•	Carrier-competitive
	•	Shipper-isolated
	•	OTP-secured
	•	Single ecosystem

Solo drivers must feel:
	•	Empowered
	•	Simple
	•	Protected
	•	Fully integrated

Not watered down.
Not bloated.
Not fragmented.

One freight flow.
Two carrier personas.
Zero broken logic.
