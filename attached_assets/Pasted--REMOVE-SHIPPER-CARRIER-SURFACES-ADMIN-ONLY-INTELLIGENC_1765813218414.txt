(REMOVE SHIPPER–CARRIER SURFACES · ADMIN-ONLY INTELLIGENCE · SIMULATED DATA)

You are acting as a Principal System Architect refining a production trucking marketplace.

The core workflow (admin-led bidding, negotiation, carrier finalization, invoicing) is already approved and must remain unchanged.

Your task is to remove conflicting surfaces, relocate intelligence to Admin, and enforce strict role isolation — without redesigning UI components or introducing new features.

You must not write code.
You must only instruct behavioral and visibility changes.

⸻

1. REMOVE “NEGOTIATIONS” PAGE FROM SHIPPER PORTAL (HARD DELETE)

Directive

The Negotiations page must be completely removed from the Shipper Portal.

Rationale
	•	Shippers are not negotiators
	•	All negotiation is Admin ↔ Carrier only
	•	This page violates the admin-intermediary rule

Enforcement
	•	Remove navigation entry
	•	Remove route access
	•	Remove any deep links
	•	Remove any notification that could lead to it

If the page exists in UI but is hidden → FAIL
It must be functionally inaccessible.

⸻

2. REMOVE “CARRIERS / CARRIER DIRECTORY” FROM SHIPPER PORTAL (FULL REMOVAL)

Directive

The Carriers / Carrier Directory / Request Quote / View Profile functionality must be entirely removed from the Shipper Portal.

Shipper must NEVER be able to:
	•	Browse carriers
	•	View carrier ratings
	•	View carrier fleet sizes
	•	Request quotes
	•	View carrier profiles
	•	See carrier service zones

Enforcement
	•	Remove “Carriers” from navigation
	•	Remove carrier cards
	•	Remove request-quote buttons
	•	Remove carrier profile routes

Shipper must not know carriers exist as selectable entities.

⸻

3. SHIPPER PORTAL — FINAL ALLOWED PAGES ONLY

After cleanup, the Shipper Portal must contain only:

✅ Dashboard
✅ Post Load (submission only, no pricing)
✅ My Loads (status tracking only)
✅ Invoices (final invoice only, post-carrier-finalization)
✅ Track Shipments (post-assignment only)
✅ Documents

If any page enables carrier discovery or negotiation → FAIL

⸻

4. NEARBY TRUCKS — MOVE TO ADMIN ONLY (SIMULATED INTELLIGENCE)

Directive

The Nearby Trucks feature must be removed from the Shipper Portal and relocated entirely to Admin Console.

New Behavior (Admin Side Only)

Admin must see a Nearby Trucks / Availability Intelligence panel that:
	•	Shows simulated carrier availability
	•	Is used only for:
	•	Pricing confidence
	•	Negotiation leverage
	•	Allocation intelligence

Data Rules
	•	Data is simulated
	•	No live GPS dependency required
	•	Display:
	•	Approximate truck counts
	•	Vehicle types
	•	Regional density
	•	Estimated pickup readiness

Shipper Access
	•	Shipper must never see nearby trucks
	•	Shipper must never infer supply-side dynamics

⸻

5. SHIPPER ROLE — LOCKED & PASSIVE (STRICT)

Shipper must be completely passive in market mechanics.

Shipper CAN:
	•	Submit load
	•	View load status
	•	View assigned carrier (after admin finalization)
	•	View & approve invoice
	•	Track shipment

Shipper CANNOT:

❌ Start bidding
❌ View bids
❌ Trigger negotiations
❌ See carrier supply
❌ Request quotes
❌ Message carriers
❌ Select carriers

If any shipper action influences carrier flow → FAIL

⸻

6. ADMIN — SOLE MARKET OPERATOR (REINFORCED)

Admin must be the only entity that can:
	•	See carrier supply intelligence
	•	Post loads to carriers
	•	Open & close bidding
	•	Negotiate pricing
	•	Select final carrier
	•	Generate invoices
	•	Control margins

All intelligence surfaces (pricing, trucks, supply, bids) must live only in Admin Console.

⸻

7. CARRIER EXPERIENCE — UNCHANGED BUT CLEAN

Carrier Portal (Enterprise + Solo) remains unchanged in UI, but behavior must ensure:
	•	Loads appear only when admin posts
	•	All bids go only to admin
	•	No carrier ever sees shipper pricing actions
	•	No carrier ever communicates with shipper

Carrier → Admin → System → Shipper
Never any other path.

⸻

8. NOTIFICATIONS — ROLE-ISOLATED (FINAL PASS)

Shipper Notifications
	•	“Your load is under admin review”
	•	“Carrier assigned”
	•	“Invoice available”
	•	“Shipment in transit”

Carrier Notifications
	•	“New admin-posted load”
	•	“Admin counter-offer”
	•	“You’ve been awarded the load”

No shipper notification may reference:
	•	Bids
	•	Carriers competing
	•	Market activity

⸻

9. ACCEPTANCE CHECK (HARD FAIL CONDITIONS)

❌ Shipper can browse carriers
❌ Shipper sees nearby trucks
❌ Shipper negotiates pricing
❌ Shipper requests quotes
❌ Shipper accesses negotiations page

✅ Admin controls all intelligence
✅ Carrier bids visible only to admin
✅ Shipper sees only finalized outcomes

⸻

FINAL GOVERNANCE STATEMENT

This platform is not a marketplace UI for shippers.
It is a managed freight exchange.
	•	Admin runs the market
	•	Carriers compete
	•	Shippers submit & approve

No discovery. No negotiation. No supply insight for shippers.

One flow.
One authority.
Zero leakage.

Execute these changes without altering any other feature or workflow.
