ADDENDUM — ADMIN AS PERMANENT INTERMEDIARY (NO DIRECT SHIPPER ↔ CARRIER)

You must enforce Admin as the sole intermediary between Shipper and Carrier at all times.

This is a hard business rule and overrides any existing direct interaction paths.

⸻

1. SHIPPER PORTAL — REMOVE ALL CARRIER INTERACTION CAPABILITIES

The Shipper Portal must never allow:
	•	Viewing carrier profiles
	•	Viewing carrier bids
	•	Viewing carrier names before assignment
	•	Messaging carriers
	•	Accepting or rejecting carrier bids
	•	Negotiating pricing
	•	Selecting a carrier directly

If any of the above exists today, it must be disabled or hidden, not redesigned.

Shipper actions are submission-only and approval-only.

⸻

2. SHIPPER PORTAL — ALLOWED ACTIONS ONLY

Shipper is allowed to:
	•	Submit a load (without pricing)
	•	View load status
	•	View final assigned carrier after admin finalization
	•	View invoice
	•	Approve / reject invoice (if enabled)
	•	Track shipment after carrier assignment

Shipper is not a marketplace participant.

⸻

3. ADMIN IS THE ONLY NEGOTIATOR (STRICT)

All negotiation must flow as:

Carrier → Admin → Carrier
Shipper → Admin → System

Never:
	•	Carrier → Shipper
	•	Shipper → Carrier

Admin must:
	•	Receive all bids
	•	Handle all counter-offers
	•	Decide final carrier
	•	Lock pricing
	•	Generate invoice

This applies to:
	•	Enterprise carriers
	•	Solo drivers
	•	Fixed price loads
	•	Negotiable loads

⸻

4. INVOICE FLOW — ADMIN CONTROLLED END-TO-END

Invoice rules:
	•	Invoice is generated only by Admin
	•	Invoice is sent only by Admin
	•	Invoice is visible to Shipper only after carrier finalization
	•	Invoice approval does not expose carrier negotiation details

Shipper sees:
	•	Final price
	•	Carrier name (post-assignment)
	•	Invoice total
	•	Payment terms

Nothing else.

⸻

5. LOAD STATUS LANGUAGE — CLEAN & ROLE-BASED

Shipper status labels must be:
	•	“Under Admin Review”
	•	“Pricing in Progress”
	•	“Carrier Being Finalized”
	•	“Carrier Assigned”
	•	“In Transit”
	•	“Completed”

Carrier status labels may include:
	•	“Bid Submitted”
	•	“Counter Received”
	•	“Awarded”

Admin sees everything.

⸻

6. REMOVE SHIPPER-SIDE TRIGGERS TO CARRIER FLOW

Any Shipper Portal functionality that:
	•	Starts bidding
	•	Unlocks carrier visibility
	•	Pushes load to marketplace

Must be removed.

Only Admin can:
	•	Post load to carriers
	•	Open bidding
	•	Close bidding
	•	Finalize carrier

⸻

7. NOTIFICATIONS — ROLE-ISOLATED

Notifications must respect role boundaries:
	•	Shipper notifications:
	•	“Admin posted your load”
	•	“Carrier assigned”
	•	“Invoice available”
	•	Carrier notifications:
	•	“New admin-posted load”
	•	“Counter from admin”
	•	“You’ve been awarded the load”

No cross-role leakage.

⸻

8. ACCEPTANCE CHECK (HARD FAIL IF BROKEN)

Confirm the following is impossible:

❌ Shipper sees carrier bids
❌ Shipper selects carrier
❌ Shipper messages carrier
❌ Shipper triggers bidding

Confirm the following always happens:

✅ Admin mediates everything
✅ Carrier competes via admin
✅ Shipper only sees finalized truth

⸻

FINAL DIRECTIVE

This is not a peer-to-peer marketplace.
This is an admin-managed freight exchange.

Admin controls:
	•	Price
	•	Negotiation
	•	Carrier selection
	•	Invoice

Shipper submits and approves.
Carrier bids and executes.

No shortcuts. No bypasses. No direct paths.
