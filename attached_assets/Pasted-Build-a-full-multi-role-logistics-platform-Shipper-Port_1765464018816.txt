Build a full multi-role logistics platform (Shipper Portal, Carrier Portal, Admin Console) where the ADMIN is the central decision-maker.
Shippers submit loads → Admin estimates price & builds margin → Admin finalizes & posts load → Carriers accept or negotiate → Trips, tracking, documents, invoices, and settlements follow.

Retain all advanced features from Loadlink-style platforms, and simulate functionality where APIs/devices are not available.

7️⃣ DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS

================================

MOCK + SIMULATED DATA REQUIRED:
	•	Suggested pricing formulas
	•	Carrier availability (7 trucks nearby)
	•	Telemetry (fuel, odometer, GPS)
	•	Monthly charts (Admin/Carrier/Shipper)
	•	Alerts & notifications

All buttons must be functional

If backend not implemented → simulate POST success + state change.

Theme

Keep clean blue + white theme with dark mode toggle.

AI Concierge

Add a sidebar assistant capable of:
	•	Explaining load performance
	•	Suggesting margins
	•	Summarizing invoices
	•	Recommending carriers

⸻

================================

8️⃣ REQUIRED ENDPOINTS (SIMULATED OK)

================================
	•	/auth/*
	•	/loads/*
	•	/admin/pricing/*
	•	/admin/invoice/*
	•	/carrier/bids/*
	•	/tracking/*
	•	/documents/*
	•	/analytics/*
	•	/notifications/*

Every endpoint must update UI state in real time.

⸻

================================

9️⃣ ACCEPTANCE TESTING (MANDATORY)

================================

Before completion, run a mock scenario:

Scenario:
A shipper posts a load → admin prices it → admin posts it → carrier bids → admin assigns → trip starts → shipper gets invoice → invoices can be downloaded → tracking live → POD uploaded → trip closes → analytics update.

If ANY step fails to update UI state → fix.

⸻

END OF MASTER PROMPT

Implement EVERYTHING above. Simulate where needed. All roles, workflows, and pricing logic must function exactly as specified.
