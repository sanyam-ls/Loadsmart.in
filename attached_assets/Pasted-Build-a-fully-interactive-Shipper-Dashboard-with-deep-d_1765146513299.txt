Build a fully interactive Shipper Dashboard with deep drill-downs for every metric tile (Active Loads, Pending Bids, In Transit, Monthly Spend). Every panel must open into a rich data module containing detailed information, CRUD actions, analytics, and real-time simulations. All data must be stored in a backend (or simulated API) and must update the dashboard instantly. Dark/Light mode toggle included.

🧨 FINAL INSTRUCTION TO REPLIT AI

Generate the complete Shipper Dashboard with all interactive modules described above. Make sure every action is functional (or realistically simulated), all data syncs across the dashboard, and the UI matches the clean blue/white style with dark mode toggle. The dashboard should feel like a live operational control system similar to Uber Freight or Flexport Shipper Portal.
