Build a fully interactive Shipper Portal with mock data powering all dashboard numbers:
	•	Active Loads
	•	Pending Bids
	•	In Transit
	•	Monthly Spend

Use a clean blue/white UI (with dark mode).

The system must behave like a real logistics platform even though mock data is used.

🔵 1. Dashboard Requirements

Populate the dashboard using mock data:
	•	Active Loads: show total number of active loads
	•	Pending Bids: show number of bids awaiting shipper response
	•	In Transit: show number of shipments currently moving
	•	Monthly Spend: show mock dollar values and % change

Every dashboard tile must be clickable and open a detailed page.

Dashboard numbers must update automatically when data changes.

🔵 2. Mock Data Requirements

Create internally defined mock datasets for:

Active Loads
	•	loadId
	•	pickup
	•	drop
	•	weight
	•	type
	•	status (“Active”)
	•	carrier: null by default
	•	eta: null

Pending Bids
	•	bidId
	•	loadId
	•	carrier name
	•	bid price
	•	ETA
	•	status (“Pending”)

In Transit
	•	loadId
	•	vehicleId
	•	pickup
	•	drop
	•	current location
	•	ETA
	•	status (“En Route”)

Monthly Spend
	•	amount
	•	percent change
	•	optional breakdown

These datasets must be used across all Shipper Portal pages.

🔵 3. Post Load → Active Loads Workflow

When the user posts a new load:
	1.	Validate the form
	2.	Auto-generate loadId
	3.	Add the new load into the Active Loads dataset
	4.	Update dashboard metrics immediately
	5.	Display the new entry in the Active Loads page
	6.	Clear form and show success message

This creates a real workflow—even though the data is mock.

⸻

🔵 4. Active Loads Page

Show a detailed list of all active loads with:
	•	Load ID
	•	Pickup → Drop
	•	Type
	•	Weight
	•	Status
	•	Carrier
	•	Actions (View / Edit / Cancel)

Actions should modify or remove items from the mock dataset.

Changes must immediately reflect on the dashboard.

⸻

🔵 5. Pending Bids Page

Show all pending bids with:
	•	Bid ID
	•	Load ID
	•	Carrier
	•	Price
	•	ETA
	•	Status

Make Load ID clickable → opens the load details page.

⸻

🔵 6. In Transit Page

Show mock in-transit loads and basic info:
	•	Current location
	•	ETA
	•	Status
	•	Vehicle ID

Only display data; no real GPS needed unless later requested.

⸻

🔵 7. Monthly Spend Page

Show:
	•	Total spend
	•	Change %
	•	Breakdown categories (mock)
	•	Table of spend per load or carrier

Dashboard must pull this value from mock dataset.

⸻

🔵 8. Syncing & State Behavior

All sections must stay synchronized.
Examples:
	•	Posting a new load increases Active Loads count
	•	Canceling a load decreases Active Loads count
	•	Moving a load to In Transit updates dashboard
	•	Changing pending bids updates its tile count

No dead or static numbers — everything reflects from the mock dataset.

⸻

🔥 FINAL INSTRUCTION

Build the Shipper Portal using internally stored mock data for dashboard metrics, loads, bids, and in-transit shipments. Ensure all dashboard tiles are dynamic, interactive, and connected to their respective detail pages. Implement a working “Post Load” flow that immediately updates Active Loads and dashboard metrics. No backend or real data required — all simulation and interactivity must feel real.
