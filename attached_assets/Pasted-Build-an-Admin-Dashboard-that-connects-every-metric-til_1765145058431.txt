Build an Admin Dashboard that connects every metric tile (Total Users, Active Loads, Verified Carriers, Monthly Volume) to real, navigable data tables with full CRUD functionality. The UI must match the dark blue/black theme shown in the screenshot. All tiles must be clickable and should drill down into detailed database views.

🔥 FINAL INSTRUCTION TO REPLIT AI

Generate a complete Admin Dashboard system where every metric tile opens a full CRUD management page, all data links back into the monthly volume insights, and the admin can manually add/edit/delete users, loads, carriers, and volume entries. Ensure all pages, buttons, modals, and filters are functional, even if some data is simulated. Use the blue/black theme from the screenshot.
