Create a file named Readme_101.md in the root directory of the project.

The content of this file must be automatically generated by analyzing the entire codebase (frontend, backend, configs, package files, CI/CD, and integrations). Do NOT generate generic content. Extract real data from the project.

The README must contain the following structured sections:

Project Documentation – Readme_101
1️⃣ Completed Project Workflow

Analyze the codebase and describe:

Overall system architecture (Frontend → Backend → Database → External APIs)

Authentication flow (if implemented)

User flow (step-by-step: login, dashboard, CRUD operations, etc.)

Admin flow (if available)

API request/response cycle

CI/CD or deployment workflow (if GitHub Actions, Docker, AWS, etc. are present)

Environment configuration usage (.env variables summary without exposing secrets)

Database schema overview (main entities and relationships)

Explain this as a real working system workflow — not theory.

2️⃣ Main Frontend Libraries & Their Purpose

Scan frontend files (package.json, src folder, config files).

For each major library:

Library Name

Version (if available)

Why it is used in this project

Where it is used (components, pages, state management, routing, etc.)

Short description of its role

Examples to look for:
React, Redux, React Router, Axios, Tailwind, Material UI, TypeScript, Form libraries, etc.

Only include libraries that are actually used in the project.

3️⃣ Main Backend Libraries & Their Purpose

Scan backend (package.json, pom.xml, requirements.txt, etc.).

For each major backend library:

Library Name

Version

Purpose in this project

Where it is used (controllers, services, middleware, auth, DB, etc.)

Look for:
Express, Spring Boot, Django, FastAPI, JWT, Mongoose, Sequelize, Prisma, TypeORM, etc.

Explain real usage based on actual code.

4️⃣ Third-Party APIs Used

Analyze the project and list all external APIs and integrations.

For each API:

API Name

Purpose in project

Endpoint usage (if visible)

Authentication method used (Bearer, API Key, OAuth, etc.)

What feature depends on it

Examples:
Payment gateways, Google APIs, AWS services, Firebase, Surepass, Twilio, Stripe, etc.

Formatting Rules

Use clean Markdown formatting

Use headings, bullet points, and tables where useful

Keep explanations technical and professional

Do not include unnecessary theory

Do not expose secrets from environment variables

Keep documentation clear and production-level

Generate a complete, ready-to-use Readme_101.md.
