Create a fully interactive “Nearby Trucks” feature inside the Shipper Portal. This feature must use simulated data to show available trucks close to the pickup location of a load. It must include intelligent matching, scoring, filters, and a complete workflow from truck discovery → selection → bid request → integration into pending bids. All behavior must feel live and real, even though the data is mock.

⸻

🔵 1. NEARBY TRUCKS — MOCK DATA GENERATION

Create a simulated dataset of trucks with the following fields:
	•	truckId
	•	truckType (e.g., 32FT, 20FT, Open, Container)
	•	currentLocation (lat, lng)
	•	distanceFromPickup (km, simulated dynamically)
	•	availabilityStatus (Available / En Route / Busy)
	•	loadCapacity (tons)
	•	carrierName
	•	reliabilityScore (1–100)
	•	speed (simulated)
	•	estimatedTimeToPickup (simulated minutes)

This dataset must refresh periodically or simulate movement.

⸻

🔵 2. DISCOVERY WORKFLOW (NEARBY TRUCKS)

Every time a user posts a load OR selects a pickup location:
	1.	System reads pickup coordinates
	2.	System compares with simulated truck locations
	3.	System calculates distances (mock calculation is fine)
	4.	System filters trucks within a configurable radius (e.g., 10–50 km)
	5.	System shows list + map view of trucks
	6.	System applies a Match Score

⸻

🔵 3. MATCH SCORE LOGIC (SIMULATED)

Each truck receives a Match Score based on:
	•	Distance from pickup
	•	Truck type suitability
	•	Load capacity match
	•	Carrier reliability score
	•	Estimated time to reach pickup

Score is 0–100 and must appear visually next to each truck.

⸻

🔵 4. FILTERS & SORT OPTIONS

Add filters to refine trucks:
	•	Truck Type
	•	Radius (5, 10, 20, 50 km)
	•	Capacity
	•	Carrier Rating
	•	Availability

Add sort options:
	•	Nearest first
	•	Highest Match Score
	•	Earliest pickup ETA
	•	Carrier rating

⸻

🔵 5. INTERACTION WORKFLOW

When user opens Nearby Trucks:

Step 1 — View trucks

User sees:
	•	Truck list
	•	Map with pins
	•	Match scores
	•	Distance & ETA

Step 2 — Select a truck

On click:
	•	Open a truck profile preview
	•	Show truck specs
	•	Carrier details
	•	Document status (mock)
	•	Reliability score

Step 3 — Request a Quote

User should see a button:

“Request Quote from Carrier”

Clicking this must:
	1.	Create a mock bid entry
	2.	Attach the bid to the selected load
	3.	Move the bid into Pending Bids instantly
	4.	Update the dashboard tile for Pending Bids
	5.	Trigger a confirmation message

Step 4 — Carrier simulated response

Simulate a response after a short delay:
	•	Carrier accepts
	•	Carrier counters
	•	Carrier declines

This updates the Pending Bids page automatically.

⸻

🔵 6. MAP + LIST SYNC

The Nearby Trucks UI must feature:
	•	A map view showing truck pins
	•	A list view showing the same trucks
	•	Hovering on a truck highlights its pin
	•	Clicking a pin highlights the truck in the list

⸻

🔵 7. WORKFLOW SYNC

The Nearby Trucks feature must synchronize with:

Active Loads
	•	When load is created → trucks shown must reflect the pickup location

Pending Bids
	•	When requesting a quote → new bid appears automatically
	•	Dashboard counts update immediately

In Transit
	•	Once bid is accepted → assigned truck moves with the load into In Transit

Monthly Spend
	•	Truck/carrier assignments can contribute mock cost data

All modules must update in real time based on the central mock dataset.

⸻

🔵 8. EMPTY STATES

If no trucks are within radius:

Show:

“No trucks found nearby. Expand your search radius or try again shortly.”

Provide CTA:

“Increase Search Radius”

⸻

🔥 FINAL INSTRUCTION TO REPLIT AI

Build a fully functional “Nearby Trucks” system inside the Shipper Portal using simulated truck data and real workflows. The feature must intelligently discover trucks near the pickup location, apply match scoring, allow users to request quotes, generate simulated bids, and sync all state changes across Active Loads, Pending Bids, In Transit, and Monthly Spend. All interactions must feel like a live logistics operating system, even though the data is mock.
