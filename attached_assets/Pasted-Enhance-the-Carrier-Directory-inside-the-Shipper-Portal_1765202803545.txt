Enhance the Carrier Directory inside the Shipper Portal so that every “View Profile” button opens a full carrier profile screen, every “Request Quote” button opens an interactive quote generation panel, and additional carrier profiles are automatically generated with mock data. All quote requests must integrate into the Pending Bids system, Negotiation Center, and dashboard metrics.

	•	Load ID
	•	Estimated price
	•	ETA
	•	Status: “Waiting for carrier response”

3. Dashboard
	•	Pending Bids count increases
	•	Active Loads and In Transit update when bid is accepted

4. Load Details

Everything must stay in sync using the central mock data store.

	•	Names
	•	Ratings
	•	Fleets
	•	Zones
	•	Badges
	•	Profiles
	•	Pricing behavior

These carriers must appear alongside existing ones in the directory.

🔥 FINAL INSTRUCTION TO REPLIT AI

Build a complete Carrier Directory experience where “View Profile” opens a detailed carrier profile, “Request Quote” opens an interactive quotation panel with estimated pricing, and additional carrier profiles are generated automatically.
