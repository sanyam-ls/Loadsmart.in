Make every load inside the Admin Console fully detailed, transparent, searchable, and synced with the Shipper Portal.

⸻

🔵 1. Create a Fully Detailed Load Information Screen

When an admin clicks any load from “All Loads,” open a full-page Load Details module containing:

Load Overview
	•	Load ID
	•	Load Title / Type (e.g., Machinery, FMCG, Bulk, Perishables, Construction Material)
	•	Status (Pending, Active, In Transit, Completed, Canceled)
	•	Priority tag (Normal / High / Critical)
	•	Date created

⸻

🔵 2. Shipper Information (Must Be Visible to Admin)

Display:

Shipper Profile
	•	Shipper Name
	•	Company Name
	•	Phone Number
	•	Email
	•	Address (optional)
	•	Account type: Verified / Unverified
	•	Total loads posted
	•	Shipper rating (mock)

Shipper Contact Options
	•	“Call Shipper” (simulated)
	•	“Email Shipper” (simulated)
	•	“View Shipper Profile”

Admins should clearly see who posted the load and how to reach them.

⸻

🔵 3. Load Specification Block

Show complete technical information:
	•	Pickup location
	•	Dropoff location
	•	Distance (km/mi)
	•	Load category (choose from preset types)
	•	Weight
	•	Dimensions (L × W × H)
	•	Load description
	•	Special handling requirements
	•	Required truck type

Admins should easily understand what exactly is being transported.

⸻

🔵 4. Assigned Carrier + Vehicle Information

Provide a complete carrier + truck breakdown:

Carrier Details
	•	Carrier company name
	•	Carrier contact number
	•	Carrier verification status
	•	Carrier rating
	•	Fleet size

Assigned Vehicle
	•	Truck type (Mini, Flatbed, Trailer, Container, Reefer, etc.)
	•	Vehicle number (mock)
	•	Driver name
	•	Driver phone
	•	Driver license (mock)
	•	Vehicle capacity
	•	RC / Insurance status

This reveals who is fulfilling the load and with what assets.

⸻

🔵 5. Route & Tracking Information

Add a “Route Details” section:
	•	Map preview (simulated)
	•	Pickup → Drop path
	•	Distance + Estimated time
	•	Live status (In Transit, Reached Pickup, Loaded, En Route, Delivered)
	•	Current mock location
	•	ETA updates

Admins should see where the load is right now.

⸻

🔵 6. Bidding & Negotiation History

Include a full history:

Bid Timeline
	•	All carriers who placed bids
	•	Prices offered
	•	Counter-offers
	•	Accepted bid
	•	Timestamp logs

Negotiation Chat Log
	•	Fake messages between shipper and carrier
	•	Rate confirmations
	•	Pickup scheduling discussion

Admins get control over pricing and negotiation transparency.

⸻

🔵 7. Cost Breakdown & Spend Analytics

Add financial transparency:
	•	Base freight cost
	•	Fuel surcharge
	•	Handling fee
	•	Platform fee (if applicable)
	•	Total shipment cost

Link this to Monthly Volume analytics.

⸻

🔵 8. Documents Section (Load-Specific)

Auto-display any documents linked by shipper or carrier:
	•	POD (Proof of Delivery)
	•	Invoice
	•	Insurance document
	•	BOL (Bill of Lading)
	•	Consignment note
	•	RC + Driver documents

Allow:
	•	View
	•	Download
	•	Replace version
	•	Approve (admin only)

⸻

🔵 9. Activity Log (Complete Timeline)

Every load should have a timestamp-based audit trail:
	•	Load created
	•	Shipper edits
	•	Carrier assigned
	•	Pickup scheduled
	•	Driver en route
	•	Documents uploaded
	•	Load delivered
	•	Admin actions

Admins must be able to see the entire lifecycle.

⸻

🔵 10. Actions Admin Can Take

Admin panel must include:
	•	Reassign Carrier
	•	Update Status
	•	Edit Load Details
	•	Cancel Load
	•	Add Admin Notes
	•	Approve / Reject Documents
	•	Trigger Sync with Shipper Portal

All buttons operate via mock data.

⸻

🔵 11. Link Everything Back to the Unified Data Layer

Any update made in Admin must reflect in:
	•	Shipper Portal (Active Loads, Pending Bids, In Transit, Completed)
	•	Carrier Portal (Assigned Loads, Bids, Negotiations)
	•	Admin Dashboard metrics
	•	Transaction Volume
	•	Load Status chart

Zero static numbers → everything must update dynamically.

⸻
