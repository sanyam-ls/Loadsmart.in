Transport and enterprise shippers are assessed for creditworthiness based on a combination of quantitative financial metrics and qualitative business factors. The primary goal is to evaluate their ability and willingness to meet financial obligations, particularly paying freight bills on time. 
Key assessment criteria include:
Financial Analysis
Payment History: This is a crucial factor, as a track record of timely payments to carriers and factoring companies is a strong indicator of future behavior.
Credit Scores: Standardized scores from industry-specific credit agencies like TransCredit and Ansonia, or general business bureaus like Dun & Bradstreet, Experian, and Equifax, are used to gauge overall financial reliability.
Financial Statements & Ratios: Lenders analyze a company's financial health using key metrics:
Cash Flow: Stable cash flow is essential for meeting debt obligations in a capital-intensive industry.
Liquidity Ratios: Measures a company's ability to meet short-term obligations (e.g., current ratio, quick ratio).
Debt-to-Equity Ratio: Indicates how much of the company's capital comes from debt versus equity.
Profitability Ratios: Assesses the efficiency and return on investment (e.g., EBITDA margin, profit margin).
Credit Utilization: The ratio of available credit to total debt.
Public Records: Filings such as bankruptcies, liens, and lawsuits can indicate financial distress and are closely examined.
Outstanding Debt: The total amount of outstanding debt is considered in relation to income and available credit. 
Qualitative Factors
Business History and Reputation: A longer, positive track record in the industry generally improves a company's perceived reliability.
Trade References: Feedback from other carriers, suppliers, and business partners provides insight into payment behavior and overall business practices.
Management Evaluation: The experience, track record, and ability of the management team to navigate industry challenges and implement effective strategies are assessed.
Scale and Diversification: Larger companies with a diversified customer base, geographical reach, and service offerings are often viewed as less risky because they are less susceptible to specific market volatilities.
Industry and Economic Conditions: External factors such as freight rate volatility, demand-supply dynamics, regulatory changes, and general economic or political instability are considered as they can impact a shipper's ability to pay. 
Credit reporting agencies in the transportation industry, such as Ansonia Credit Data and TransCredit (now a part of OTR Solutions, which offers broker credit checks), specialize in gathering and analyzing this specific data to provide a comprehensive credit profile.
