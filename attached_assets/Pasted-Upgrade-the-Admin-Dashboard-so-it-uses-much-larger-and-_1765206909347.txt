Upgrade the Admin Dashboard so it uses much larger and more realistic mock datasets.
All expanded data must remain synchronized with the unified data layer used by the Shipper Portal.

Make the platform feel like it is operating at enterprise scale.

⸻

🔵 1. Expand Total Users Dataset (large simulation)

Increase total users from a small number (22) to a realistic dataset such as:

Users: 250–500 mock users

Include:
	•	Shippers
	•	Carriers
	•	Dispatchers
	•	Admins

Each user record must include:
	•	userId
	•	name
	•	company
	•	email
	•	role
	•	region
	•	accountStatus
	•	verificationStatus
	•	createdDate
	•	lastActive

Admin Console must display:
	•	Total Users count (250–500)
	•	Growth % trend (auto-calculated from mock historical data)
	•	A deeper “Users” page with searchable, sortable tables

⸻

🔵 2. Expand Active Loads Dataset

Increase Active Loads to a realistic operational count:

Loads: 120–300 active loads

Each load record must include:
	•	loadId
	•	shipperId
	•	pickup & dropoff
	•	distance
	•	weight, dimensions
	•	load type
	•	createdDate
	•	status (Pending, Active, In Transit, Completed)
	•	assignedCarrier
	•	ETA
	•	spend amount

Admin Dashboard must show:
	•	Active loads count (120–300)
	•	Load status breakdown chart
	•	Clickable tile → navigates to All Loads table
	•	Load filters (status, date, shipper, carrier)

⸻

🔵 3. Expand Carriers Dataset

Increase carriers to:

Carriers: 60–150 carriers

Each carrier should have:
	•	carrierId
	•	company name
	•	fleet size
	•	service zones
	•	verification status
	•	compliance documents
	•	rating
	•	reliability score
	•	avg response time
	•	completed shipments

Admin Dashboard must show:
	•	Verified carriers count (50–120)
	•	Verification rate (auto-calculated)
	•	Tile linking to a full Carriers management page

⸻

🔵 4. Expand Monthly Volume & Analytics

Use a larger historical dataset to generate richer analytics:
	•	Monthly transaction volume for 12–24 months
	•	Auto-calc revenue trends
	•	Auto-calc load volume changes
	•	Simulated seasonality
	•	Randomized spikes (festivals, peak season)

Transaction Volume chart should:
	•	Expand to full interactive mode
	•	Support drilldown → month, week, day
	•	Show mock tooltip data for every point

⸻

🔵 5. Create Deeper Analytics Pages

Users Analytics
	•	Active vs inactive users
	•	New registrations over time
	•	Users by region
	•	Users by role

Load Analytics
	•	Load volume by region
	•	Load types distribution
	•	Carrier assignment patterns
	•	On-time delivery rate

Carrier Analytics
	•	Carrier performance scores
	•	Fleet utilization (simulated)
	•	Verification pipeline volume

All analytics must derive from the enlarged datasets.

⸻

🔵 6. Sync Expanded Data With Shipper Portal

All datasets must be centrally stored and shared across both portals.

This means:

If Shipper Portal creates:
	•	A new load
	•	A new user
	•	A new document
	•	A new negotiation
	•	A new bid

→ Admin Console metrics must update instantly.

If Admin updates:
	•	User status
	•	Carrier verification
	•	Load assignment

→ Shipper Portal must update instantly.

⸻

🔵 7. Update Dashboard Metrics to Display Full-Scale Data

Update the Admin Dashboard tiles to show:

Total Users: 250–500

Active Loads: 120–300

Verified Carriers: 60–120

Monthly Volume: $1.5M–$10M (mock scaling)

All percentages must be auto-calculated from mock historical datasets.

⸻

🔥 FINAL INSTRUCTION TO REPLIT AI

Expand the Admin Console’s mock datasets for Users, Loads, Carriers, and Transaction Volume to enterprise scale, using 250–500 users, 120–300 loads, and 60–150 carriers. Update all dashboard tiles, charts, analytics pages, and tables to reflect these larger datasets. Maintain full synchronization with the Shipper Portal’s unified mock data store so that all updates propagate instantly across portals. Ensure the Admin Dashboard offers deep, realistic analytics using the expanded data.
