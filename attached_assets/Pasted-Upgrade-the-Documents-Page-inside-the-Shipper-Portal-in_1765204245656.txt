Upgrade the Documents Page inside the Shipper Portal into a fully functional document management system powered by mock data. It must support:
	•	Uploading documents
	•	Viewing documents in a PDF viewer
	•	Downloading documents
	•	Metadata display
	•	Expiry tracking
	•	Filtering and searching
	•	Linking documents to loads
	•	Quick actions

The page must feel like a real logistics document vault.

⸻

🔵 1. Document Storage (Mock Data)

Create a document dataset with fields:
	•	documentId
	•	fileName
	•	fileSize
	•	fileType (e.g., PDF, Image)
	•	category (POD, Invoice, Insurance, RC, BOL, etc.)
	•	loadId (optional link)
	•	uploadedBy
	•	uploadedDate
	•	expiryDate (optional)
	•	status: Active, Expiring Soon, Expired
	•	notes (short description)
	•	tags (user-added)
	•	version (integer)

This dataset powers the entire page.

⸻

🔵 2. Document Upload Flow

When user clicks Upload Document, open a modal where they can:
	•	Upload a PDF or image (simulated)
	•	Select Document Type (dropdown)
	•	Link to a Load (dropdown with load titles)
	•	Add notes
	•	Add tags
	•	Add expiry date if applicable
	•	Save document

On Save:
	1.	Add the new document to the mock dataset
	2.	Recalculate expiring/expired statuses
	3.	Update the Documents Page immediately
	4.	Show a success toast

⸻

🔵 3. Document Cards – Enhanced UI

Each document card must display:
	•	File icon
	•	File name
	•	File size
	•	Category badge (POD / Invoice / Insurance / RC / etc.)
	•	Linked Load ID
	•	Uploaded date
	•	Expiry date (highlight in yellow or red)
	•	Status indicator:
	•	Green = Active
	•	Yellow = Expiring Soon
	•	Red = Expired

Actions on card:
	•	View → open PDF viewer
	•	Download
	•	Delete
	•	More Info → open document detail panel

⸻

🔵 4. Document Detail View (Full Panel)

When a document is clicked, open a detailed slide-out panel showing:

Document Overview
	•	File name
	•	Type
	•	Category
	•	File size
	•	Version number
	•	Tags
	•	Linked Load
	•	Uploaded by
	•	Uploaded date

	•	Download
	•	Delete
	•	Add tags
	•	Add notes

This must feel like a real enterprise document management panel.

⸻

🔵 5. Expiry Tracking System

The system must automatically:
	•	Identify documents expiring within 30 days → “Expiring Soon”
	•	Identify documents past expiry → “Expired”
	•	Display warning banner:
“X documents expiring soon — review to avoid service interruptions.”
	•	Apply color-coded statuses on cards

This simulates compliance management.

⸻

🔵 6. Filters & Search

Enable:

Search bar:

Search by file name, load ID, document type, or tags.

Filters:
	•	Document Type (POD, Invoice, Insurance, RC, BOL, All Types)
	•	Expiry status (Active, Expiring Soon, Expired)
	•	Load filter (select load to show its documents)
	•	Date uploaded

Sorting:
	•	Newest
	•	Oldest
	•	Soonest expiring
	•	Largest size

All filters must dynamically update the displayed lists.

⸻

🔵 7. PDF Viewer Integration (Simulated)

When user clicks View, open a modal with:
	•	Full-page PDF viewer (mock)
	•	Page scroll
	•	Zoom in/out
	•	Rotate
	•	Download button

If document is image → show photo viewer.

⸻

🔵 8. Document Linking to Loads

If user opens a Load Details page, the load should display:
	•	POD
	•	Invoice
	•	BOL
	•	Any linked docs

And clicking on them should open the same viewer.

This builds ecosystem-level coherence.

⸻

🔵 9. Document Upload Templates

Create predefined upload templates for:
	•	POD Template
	•	BOL Template
	•	Invoice Template
	•	Insurance Template
	•	RC Document Template

When the user selects one:
	•	Auto-fill some fields
	•	Ask for attachment
	•	Auto-set category
	•	Auto-assign expiry (insurance/RC)

Makes the UX feel intelligent.

⸻

🔵 10. Dashboard Sync

If applicable:
	•	Dashboard must show “Documents Expiring Soon” count
	•	Alerts must appear in notifications
