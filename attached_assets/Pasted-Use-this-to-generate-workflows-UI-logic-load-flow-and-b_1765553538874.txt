🔶 LOAD FLOW (INDIAN MODEL — END-TO-END)

1. Shipper creates load

Indian city → city lane + truck type → weight → material.

2. Admin views as “Pending Load”

Opens it → assigns estimation cost using India freight norms.

3. Admin sends invoice to Shipper

Shipper views → approves/negotiates.

4. After approval, Admin opens load for bidding

Carriers across India can place INR-based bids.

5. Admin awards load

Carrier receives award → updates driver & truck details.

6. Pickup → Transit → Delivery

Driver sends updates, GPS movement, arrival at warehouse, unloading.

7. POD Upload

Carrier uploads POD → Shipper verifies → Admin closes load.
