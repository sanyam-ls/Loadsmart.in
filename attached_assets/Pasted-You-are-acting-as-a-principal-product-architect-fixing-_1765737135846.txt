You are acting as a principal product architect fixing a fragmented workflow in a trucking marketplace platform.

The UI, modals, dashboards, and features already exist.
Your task is to re-wire the sequence, visibility, and state transitions so the system works as one continuous flow.

You must not remove, redesign, or add new features.
You must only fix how existing actions connect across portals.

⸻

1. CORE PROBLEM TO SOLVE (ACKNOWLEDGE FIRST)

Currently:
	•	Admin actions are split across multiple screens
	•	Invoice flow is detached from load posting
	•	Shipper sees loads but not invoices
	•	Carrier receives notifications but cannot open the actual load
	•	Loads show as “posted” but do not appear in the marketplace
	•	Actions say “No action required” when action is actually required

This is a segmentation bug, not a feature gap.

⸻

2. SINGLE CONTINUOUS WORKFLOW (MANDATORY)

There must be ONE linear operational flow:

Admin → Carrier → Shipper

No parallel dead ends.
No screen that ends the journey.

⸻

3. ADMIN CONSOLE — ACTION CONSOLIDATION

Admin Load Actions MUST be unified into ONE operational surface

For every load in Admin Console, the Actions column must always show:
	•	Price & Post Load
	•	Send Invoice to Shipper
	•	View Carrier Responses

These are not separate workflows.
They are steps of the same workflow.

Rule:

Admin should never need to leave the load context to:
	•	Post the load
	•	Send invoice
	•	Track carrier responses

⸻

4. ADMIN “PRICE & POST” — MUST DO BOTH

When Admin clicks Price & Post:

It must:
	1.	Post the load to the Carrier Marketplace
	2.	Generate the invoice draft
	3.	Prepare the load for carrier bidding

It must not:
	•	Only post the load
	•	Or only create an invoice
	•	Or stop at a toast message

Posting a load without invoice linkage is invalid.

⸻

5. INVOICE FLOW — ADMIN → SHIPPER (FIX THIS)

Shipper MUST have an Invoice view in their portal

Rules:
	•	Shipper portal must show:
	•	Load
	•	Linked Invoice
	•	Invoice status (Pending / Approved / Paid)

Current behavior (invoice only in admin) is incorrect.

When Admin sends invoice:
	•	Shipper sees it immediately
	•	Invoice opens from Shipper portal
	•	Invoice approval/unapproval updates load status

Invoice is not a separate system — it is a child of the load.

⸻

6. SHIPPER PORTAL — CLEAN & COMPLETE

Shipper portal must show for each load:
	•	Load details
	•	Invoice (linked)
	•	Status updates

Shipper actions:
	•	Approve invoice
	•	Reject / counter invoice (if allowed)
	•	Track load after assignment

Shipper must not be blocked from seeing invoices.

⸻

7. CARRIER PORTAL — NOTIFICATION → LOAD ACCESS (CRITICAL FIX)

Current broken behavior:

Carrier receives notification
BUT cannot:
	•	Open the load
	•	Find it in marketplace
	•	Act on it

This is unacceptable.

Required behavior:

Every carrier notification must:
	•	Deep-link to the actual load
	•	Open either:
	•	Accept Fixed Price modal, or
	•	Place Bid modal

Carrier must also be able to:
	•	Search the same load by Load ID
	•	Find it in “Available Loads”

A notification without access is a broken promise.

⸻

8. CARRIER MARKETPLACE — LOAD VISIBILITY RULES

A load is visible to carriers only if:
	•	Admin has clicked Price & Post
	•	Invoice is generated (even if pending shipper approval)

Once visible:
	•	Carrier can accept or counter
	•	Modal behavior remains unchanged
	•	Actions update shared load state

⸻

9. REMOVE “NO ACTION REQUIRED” FALSE STATES

If a load is:
	•	Pending invoice
	•	Pending carrier response
	•	Pending shipper approval

Then an action is required.

“No action required” must appear only when:
	•	Load is completed
	•	Or fully idle

Any other usage is incorrect.

⸻

10. STATE SYNCHRONIZATION (NO NEW STATES)

Do not add new states.
Just ensure existing ones propagate correctly.

When:
	•	Admin posts load → Carrier sees it
	•	Carrier bids → Admin sees it
	•	Admin assigns → Shipper sees carrier
	•	Admin sends invoice → Shipper sees invoice
	•	Shipper approves → Carrier proceeds

One action → all portals update.

⸻

11. MODALS MUST STAY EXACTLY AS THEY ARE
	•	Accept Fixed Price modal stays
	•	Place Bid modal stays
	•	Invoice Builder stays

Only requirement:

They must now actually move the workflow forward.

No modal should ever close without:
	•	A real state change, or
	•	A visible error

⸻

12. ACCEPTANCE CHECK (SYSTEM MUST PASS)

For a single load:
	1.	Admin prices & posts load
	2.	Load appears in carrier marketplace
	3.	Carrier opens load from notification
	4.	Carrier accepts or counters
	5.	Admin sees response
	6.	Admin sends invoice
	7.	Shipper sees invoice
	8.	Shipper approves
	9.	Carrier proceeds with trip

If any step requires guessing where to go next → FAIL.

⸻

FINAL DIRECTIVE

You are not building features.
You are removing friction between existing ones.

The system must feel like:

“I click once, and the next person sees it immediately.”

No dead ends.
No ghost loads.
No invisible invoices.
No notifications without access.

Fix the flow — keep everything else untouched.
