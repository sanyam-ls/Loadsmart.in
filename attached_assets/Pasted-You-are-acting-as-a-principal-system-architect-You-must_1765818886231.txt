You are acting as a principal system architect.
You must modify system behavior, permissions, and data flow, not UI aesthetics.

This system must behave as one unified freight ecosystem, not siloed portals.

You are not allowed to mark the task complete until every rule below is enforced.

⸻

0. ABSOLUTE RULE — SYSTEM DOES NOT “RUN”, IT “ENFORCES”

If any feature:
	•	Appears to work visually
	•	But does not update other portals
	•	Or does not change load state

👉 That feature is considered NOT IMPLEMENTED.

⸻

1. SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH — LOAD STATE ENGINE (MANDATORY)

Every load must exist in exactly one state globally.

You must enforce these states system-wide:
	1.	SUBMITTED_BY_SHIPPER
	2.	PRICING_BY_ADMIN
	3.	POSTED_TO_CARRIERS
	4.	BIDDING_OPEN
	5.	NEGOTIATION_ACTIVE
	6.	CARRIER_FINALIZED
	7.	INVOICE_READY
	8.	INVOICE_SENT
	9.	INVOICE_APPROVED
	10.	IN_TRANSIT
	11.	COMPLETED

No button, page, or action may bypass state rules.

⸻

2. ADMIN-POSTED LOAD MUST APPEAR ON CARRIER PLATFORM (FIX THIS)

When Admin clicks “Post to Carriers”:

You must:
	•	Change load state → POSTED_TO_CARRIERS
	•	Push the load into:
	•	Enterprise Carrier Marketplace
	•	Solo Driver Load Feed
	•	Mark load as:
	•	“Posted by Admin”
	•	“Awaiting Bids”

If a carrier cannot see this load → FAIL

⸻

3. CARRIER BIDS MUST TRIGGER ADMIN NEGOTIATION AUTOMATICALLY

When any carrier submits a bid:

You must:
	•	Create a bid record linked to the load
	•	Immediately update load state → NEGOTIATION_ACTIVE
	•	Surface that load in:
	•	Admin → Negotiation Queue
	•	Admin → Bid History (Load View)

Admin must never hunt for bids.

If a carrier bid exists and admin does not see it → FAIL

⸻

4. ADMIN NEGOTIATION — SINGLE CONTROL CENTER

Admin must have one negotiation screen per load showing:

For each bid (simulated + real):
	•	Carrier name
	•	Carrier type:
	•	ENTERPRISE
	•	SOLO_DRIVER
	•	Bid amount
	•	Timestamp
	•	Notes
	•	Truck (if provided)

Admin actions:
	•	Accept bid
	•	Reject bid
	•	Counter bid (price change)

Admin may negotiate with multiple carriers, but:

⚠️ Admin can finalize ONLY ONE carrier

⸻

5. FINALIZATION UNLOCKS INVOICE — NOTHING ELSE CAN

Once admin accepts one bid:

You must:
	•	Auto-reject all other bids
	•	Lock the load
	•	Update state → CARRIER_FINALIZED
	•	Reveal a new admin-only button:

👉 “Send Invoice to Shipper”

This button must NOT exist before this step.

⸻

6. INVOICE FLOW — STRICT SEQUENCING

Invoice rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
	•	Invoice cannot exist before CARRIER_FINALIZED
	•	Invoice must reference:
	•	Final carrier
	•	Final negotiated price
	•	Invoice is created ONLY by Admin
	•	Invoice is visible to Shipper ONLY after Admin sends it

Shipper never sees invoices early.

⸻

7. SHIPPER PORTAL — ZERO CARRIER INTERACTION

You must remove or disable the following from Shipper Portal:

❌ Carrier Directory
❌ Negotiations
❌ Nearby Trucks
❌ Carrier profiles
❌ Bids
❌ Messaging carriers

Shipper is allowed ONLY:
	•	Submit load (no price)
	•	View load status
	•	View assigned carrier (after finalization)
	•	View invoice (after sent)
	•	Approve / reject invoice
	•	Track shipment

If shipper sees bidding or carriers → FAIL

⸻

8. ADMIN CARRIER MANAGEMENT — SPLIT CORRECTLY

Admin → Carriers Page

Must show ONLY VERIFIED carriers:
	•	Eligible to receive loads
	•	Eligible to bid

Admin → Verification Page

Must show:
	•	Pending
	•	Rejected
	•	Suspended
	•	Under review

Unverified carriers must NEVER:
	•	Appear in marketplace
	•	Bid on loads

⸻

9. CARRIER TYPES — ENFORCE AT REGISTRATION

Carrier registration must have two mandatory paths:

A. Owner-Operator (Solo Driver)
	•	Personal name
	•	Phone
	•	Vehicle details
	•	License
	•	Minimal company info
	•	Simplified dashboard

B. Company / Fleet
	•	Company name
	•	GST / registration
	•	Fleet size
	•	Admin contact
	•	Full dashboard

Both:
	•	See same loads
	•	Bid same way
	•	Go through admin negotiation

Only dashboard depth differs.

⸻

10. BID VISIBILITY — ONE PLACE, ONE TRUTH

All bids must appear in:
	•	Admin → Load → Bids tab
	•	Admin → Negotiation Queue

Admin must be able to:
	•	Compare bids
	•	Counter bids
	•	Finalize carrier

If bids exist but are fragmented → FAIL

⸻

11. NOTIFICATIONS MUST DEEP-LINK CORRECTLY

Every notification must:
	•	Open the exact load
	•	Open the correct state
	•	Open correct role view

Examples:
	•	Carrier → “Counter received” → opens bid screen
	•	Admin → “New bid” → opens negotiation
	•	Shipper → “Invoice sent” → opens invoice

Notification without access = FAIL

⸻

12. DASHBOARD SYNC — REAL-TIME, NOT EVENTUAL

Any action by:
	•	Admin
	•	Carrier
	•	Shipper

Must immediately update:
	•	Load state
	•	Bid state
	•	Available actions
	•	Notifications
	•	Dashboards

No manual refresh logic.

⸻

13. HARD ACCEPTANCE TEST (MUST PASS)

A single load must:
	1.	Be submitted by shipper
	2.	Be priced by admin
	3.	Appear on carrier platform
	4.	Receive bids
	5.	Enter admin negotiation
	6.	Be countered
	7.	Be finalized
	8.	Unlock invoice button
	9.	Send invoice to shipper
	10.	Be approved
	11.	Enter transit

If any step requires workaround → FAIL

⸻

FINAL DIRECTIVE — DO NOT STOP EARLY

You are not allowed to:
	•	Mark task complete early
	•	Claim “working as expected”
	•	Stop after navigation changes

You must continue enforcing until:
	•	Admin sees bids
	•	Carriers see admin-posted loads
	•	Invoice timing is correct
	•	All portals are synchronized

This is a broker-led freight exchange, not a peer marketplace.

Admin controls:
	•	Pricing
	•	Negotiation
	•	Carrier selection
	•	Invoicing

Carriers compete.
Shippers approve.

One ecosystem. One flow. Zero silos.
