You are acting as a principal system architect and product engineer for a trucking marketplace platform.

Your task is to fix and enforce the real operational workflow between Admin Console, Carrier Portal, and Shipper Portal.
UI already exists. The problem is broken state propagation and fake success actions.

You must not generate code.
You must only define behavior, state rules, workflows, and data synchronization logic.

⸻

1. CORE RULE — SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH

There must be one shared Load entity used by:
	•	Admin Console
	•	Carrier Portal
	•	Shipper Portal

No isolated UI-only states are allowed.

If a load exists in Admin, it must exist system-wide.

⸻

2. LOAD LIFECYCLE (ENFORCE STRICTLY)

Every load must follow this lifecycle:
	•	Submitted by shipper → PENDING_REVIEW
	•	Awaiting admin pricing → PENDING_PRICING
	•	Admin finalizes cost → PRICED
	•	Admin clicks Price & Post → POSTED_TO_CARRIERS
	•	Carriers interact → BIDDING_OPEN
	•	Counter received → COUNTER_RECEIVED
	•	Admin accepts carrier → ASSIGNED
	•	Trip starts → IN_TRANSIT
	•	Delivery completed → COMPLETED

A load cannot skip states.

⸻

3. FIX “PRICE & POST” — NO MORE FAKE SUCCESS

When Admin clicks Price & Post:

This must happen internally:
	•	Load state changes from PENDING_PRICING → POSTED_TO_CARRIERS
	•	Final admin price is locked
	•	Platform margin is frozen
	•	Load becomes visible in Carrier Portal immediately
	•	Load becomes available for carrier actions

Critical rule:

If the load does NOT appear in Carrier Portal →
DO NOT show “Load Posted Successfully.”

Instead show a failure state.

⸻

4. CARRIER PORTAL — REAL VISIBILITY & ACTIONS

Once a load is POSTED_TO_CARRIERS, carriers must see it in:
Available Loads

Each carrier must be able to:
	•	View load details
	•	Accept at admin price
	•	Counter offer with new price + note
	•	See status updates live

Carrier actions must write back to the same Load record, not a copy.

⸻

5. NEGOTIATION IS ADMIN-CONTROLLED (MEDIATOR MODEL)

Shipper does NOT negotiate.

Admin:
	•	Sees all carrier bids & counters
	•	Can accept, reject, or re-counter
	•	Controls final assignment

Carrier:
	•	Can only accept or counter admin-posted price

Shipper:
	•	Only sees status updates, not bidding mechanics

⸻

6. BID & COUNTER SYNCHRONIZATION

When a carrier counters:
	•	Load state becomes COUNTER_RECEIVED
	•	Admin sees:
	•	Carrier name
	•	Counter price
	•	Message
	•	Carrier sees bid as “Pending Admin Decision”

When admin responds:
	•	Carrier portal updates instantly
	•	Load status updates everywhere

No refresh-only updates.
State must propagate automatically.

⸻

7. INVOICE BUILDER — REAL FUNCTIONALITY

Admin must be able to:
	•	Build invoice after pricing OR after negotiation
	•	Edit line items (freight, fuel, handling, margin)
	•	Save draft
	•	Send invoice to shipper

When invoice is sent:
	•	Shipper portal receives invoice
	•	Invoice opens as viewable document
	•	Load links to invoice permanently

If invoice send fails:
	•	Do NOT change load state
	•	Show error clearly

⸻

8. SHIPPER PORTAL — READ-ONLY, STATUS-DRIVEN

Shipper can:
	•	Submit load
	•	Track status
	•	View invoice
	•	View assigned carrier
	•	Track trip

Shipper cannot:
	•	Edit pricing
	•	Bid
	•	Negotiate

⸻

9. BUTTON BEHAVIOR — ZERO DEAD CLICKS

Every button must:
	•	Either change system state
	•	Or open a workflow modal
	•	Or show a blocking error

Buttons that only show UI feedback without state change are bugs.

This includes:
	•	Price & Post
	•	Lock & Post
	•	Send Invoice
	•	Accept / Counter

⸻

10. ERROR HANDLING (MANDATORY)

If any operation fails:
	•	Do not show success toast
	•	Show reasoned failure message
	•	Do not advance load state

Examples:
	•	“Failed to post: carrier board not updated”
	•	“Invoice not sent: shipper not reachable”

⸻

11. ACCEPTANCE TEST — MUST PASS

A load submitted by shipper must be:
	1.	Visible in Admin under Pending Review
	2.	Priceable by Admin
	3.	Posted via Price & Post
	4.	Immediately visible in Carrier Portal
	5.	Counterable by Carrier
	6.	Negotiable by Admin
	7.	Assignable to Carrier
	8.	Trackable by Shipper

If any step breaks → system is incorrect.

⸻

12. CONSTRAINTS
	•	Keep existing advanced features from Loadlink-style platforms
	•	Modify only the workflow logic
	•	Preserve UI look & feel
	•	No demo-only flows
	•	No fake success states

⸻

FINAL INSTRUCTION

You are not designing screens.
You are enforcing operational truth.

If a user action claims something happened, the system must reflect it everywhere.
