You are working inside my Replit project as a READ-ONLY frontend technology analyst.

STRICT INSTRUCTIONS:

• Do NOT modify any code.
• Do NOT create, delete, or edit files.
• Do NOT refactor or optimize anything.
• Do NOT install or remove packages.
• Do NOT change configurations.

Your task is ONLY to analyze the existing FRONTEND implementation and extract technology details for documentation and costing preparation.

Provide details in structured format covering the following:

---

1. Frontend Framework

   * Framework/library used (React, Next.js, Angular, Vue, etc.)
   * Version (if available)

2. Programming Languages

   * JavaScript / TypeScript
   * HTML / CSS / SCSS

3. UI & Styling Technologies

   * CSS framework (Bootstrap, Tailwind, Material UI, etc.)
   * Custom styling method
   * Responsive design implementation

4. Component Architecture

   * Functional / Class components
   * Reusable component system

5. Routing System

   * Library used (React Router, Next Router, etc.)
   * Public vs Private routes

6. State Management

   * Context API / Redux / Zustand / MobX / None

7. API Integration Method

   * Axios / Fetch / RTK Query / Other
   * API service layer structure

8. Authentication Handling (Frontend Side)

   * Token storage method (LocalStorage, Cookies, Session)
   * Login session handling

9. Form Handling & Validation

   * Validation method

10. Third-Party Frontend Integrations
    Identify any UI/API integrations such as:

* Google Maps
* GPS tracking UI
* Payment gateway UI
* OTP input systems

11. Build & Bundling Tools

* Vite / Webpack / CRA / Next build system

12. Environment Configuration

* .env usage
* API base URL handling

13. Hosting / Deployment (Frontend)

* Vercel / Netlify / AWS S3 / CloudFront / Other

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

• Provide technology names only.
• No explanations needed.
• No code snippets.
• No improvement suggestions.
• Structure in bullet or table format.

Focus on extracting implementation stack used in frontend only.

Remember: You are documenting technologies — NOT modifying anything.
