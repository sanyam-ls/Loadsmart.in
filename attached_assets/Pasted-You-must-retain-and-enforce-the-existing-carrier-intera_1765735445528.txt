You must retain and enforce the existing carrier interaction modals exactly as they appear today, while ensuring they are fully connected to real system state.

These modals are not optional UI — they are the carrier’s primary transaction surface.

⸻

1. FIXED PRICE LOAD — ACCEPT FLOW (MANDATORY)

When a carrier clicks Accept on a fixed-price, admin-posted load:

The system must:
	•	Open the “Accept Fixed Price Load” modal (unchanged layout)
	•	Display:
	•	Match percentage
	•	Route
	•	Shipper name
	•	Load type, weight, distance
	•	Admin price (read-only)
	•	Recommended trucks
	•	Clearly state that this is an admin-priced load

On “Accept Fixed Price”:
	•	Carrier intent is recorded
	•	Load state moves to:
	•	ASSIGNED or AWAITING_ADMIN_FINAL_CONFIRMATION
	•	Admin is immediately notified
	•	Carrier sees confirmation state
	•	Load disappears from “Available Loads” for other carriers

The modal must not close with success unless the state actually updates system-wide.

⸻

2. NEGOTIABLE LOAD — PLACE BID FLOW (MANDATORY)

When a carrier clicks Place Bid on a negotiable admin-posted load:

The system must:
	•	Open the “Place Your Bid” modal (unchanged layout)
	•	Pre-fill:
	•	Admin price
	•	Bid input field
	•	Provide:
	•	-5%, Match, +5% quick actions
	•	Recommended trucks
	•	Clearly label the load as Negotiable

On “Submit Bid”:
	•	A bid record is created against the same load
	•	Load state moves to COUNTER_RECEIVED
	•	Admin sees:
	•	Carrier name
	•	Bid amount
	•	Timestamp
	•	Carrier sees bid as “Pending Admin Decision”

No silent submission. No UI-only confirmation.

⸻

3. MODALS MUST WORK FOR BOTH LOAD TYPES

Both real admin-posted loads and simulated loads must:
	•	Open the same modals
	•	Use the same accept / bid flows
	•	Behave identically in UI

Difference:
	•	Simulated loads may auto-resolve internally
	•	Real loads must notify admin and require decisions

From carrier perspective:

There is no difference.

⸻

4. STATE CONSISTENCY RULE (CRITICAL)

If a carrier:
	•	Accepts a fixed price load, or
	•	Submits a counter bid

Then:
	•	That action must update the shared Load entity
	•	The change must reflect immediately in:
	•	Admin Console
	•	Carrier Portal
	•	(Where relevant) Shipper Portal

If the modal closes but the load remains unchanged → this is a system failure.

⸻

5. NO MODAL REGRESSION ALLOWED

You are not allowed to:
	•	Remove these modals
	•	Replace them with inline actions
	•	Simplify them
	•	Turn them into static demos

These modals are locked UX.

You may only:
	•	Connect them to real state
	•	Enforce real outcomes
	•	Block false success

⸻

6. FAILURE HANDLING (STRICT)

If any accept or bid action fails:
	•	Keep modal open
	•	Show a clear error
	•	Do not update load state
	•	Do not show success feedback

Examples:
	•	“Failed to submit bid — admin not reachable”
	•	“Accept failed — load already assigned”

⸻

7. ACCEPTANCE CHECK (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

For both modals:
	•	Modal opens ✔
	•	Action submits ✔
	•	Load state updates ✔
	•	Admin sees action ✔
	•	Carrier sees confirmation ✔

If any step breaks, the modal is considered non-functional.

⸻

FINAL DIRECTIVE

These modals must continue to open exactly like this,
but now they must actually do something real.

No cosmetic success.
No UI illusions.
Only state-true actions.
